We are investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which microglia and other immune cells regulate central nervous system white matter health across the lifespan. We are identifying new roles for microglia in myelin development, homeostasis, and ageing.

We are identifying the roles of microglia and other immune cells in regulating myelin development or regeneration following injury, revealing therapeutic targets and strategies for conditions in which central nervous system white matter health is poor (e.g. perinatal brain injury/ cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and normal ageing/ dementia). We actively collaborate with, and consult for, pharmaceutical industry to support drug development.

We use a comprehensive approach to our research, combining experimental modelling (in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo), transgenic and pharmacological manipulation, ‘omics (digital spatial profiling, RNA seq, sc-RNAseq, TRAPseq, proteomics), drug screening and nanoparticle delivery, and human neuropathological analysis and cell culture.
